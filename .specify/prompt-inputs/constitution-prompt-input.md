# Constitution Prompt Input for Spec Kit
The prompt should describe principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements. Include governance for how these principles should guide technical decisions and implementation choices. The prompt should also outline the need for the agent to verify and research, debug and investigate code variables, types and functions to ensure accuracy and reliability in the generated code both in frontend code as well as backend code. Code correctness should be verified using end-to-end tests meaning that a client actions are automated. This is NOT a test first approach, but rather a verification and debugging approach to ensure the code works as intended.
